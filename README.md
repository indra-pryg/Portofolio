## [1. London Housing: Poject Overview](https://github.com/indra-pryg/Data-Science/tree/main/London%20Housing)
London Housing is a dataset to analyze average sales, the number of criminals in the area and (date, month, year). This data set includes area, average_price, code, date, house_sold, no_of_crimes and year.

## [3. Udemy Course: Poject Overview](https://github.com/indra-pryg/Data-Science/tree/main/Udemy%20Course)
This dataset contains 3.682 records of courses from 4 subjects (Business Finance, Graphic Design, Musical Instruments and Web Design) taken from Udemy.
Udemy is a massive online open course (MOOC) platform that offers both free and paid courses. Anybody can create a course, a business model by which allowed Udemy to have hundreds of thousands of courses.

## [4. Breast Cancer Winconsin (Diagnostic): Poject Overview](https://github.com/indra-pryg/Data-Science/tree/main/Breast%20Cancer%20Wisconsin%20(Diagnostic))
Features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.
Separating plane described above was obtained using Multisurface Method-Tree (MSM-T) [K. P. Bennett, "Decision Tree Construction Via Linear Programming." Proceedings of the 4th Midwest Artificial Intelligence and Cognitive Science Society, pp. 97-101, 1992], a classification method which uses linear programming to construct a decision tree. Relevant features were selected using an exhaustive search in the space of 1-4 features and 1-3 separating planes.
The actual linear program used to obtain the separating plane in the 3-dimensional space is that described in: [K. P. Bennett and O. L. Mangasarian: "Robust Linear Programming Discrimination of Two Linearly Inseparable Sets", Optimization Methods and Software 1, 1992, 23-34].
